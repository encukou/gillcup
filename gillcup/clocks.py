"""Asyncio-based discrete-time simulation infrastructure

A clock keeps track of *time*. But, what is time?

If you are familiar with the :mod:`asyncio` library,
you might know the :func:`asyncio.sleep` coroutine.
It "sleeps" roughly for a given number of seconds,
usually based on the computer's system time.
Since the Python process does not control this time, ``sleep()`` may sleep
longer than requested if the event loop is busy.
Also, the system time always changes:
so it is not possible to do two actions at exactly the same time.
For animations and simulations, such time is unusable.
Thus, time in Gillcup is a very different beast.

Gillcup time is a quantity that *increases in discrete intervals*.
On other words, it can never go backwards,
and it does not change while animation/simulation code is executing.

You can schedule an function for any time in the future.
When the clock advances to that time, the clock is frozen at the event's
scheduled time, and the function is called.

The passage of Gillcup time is entirely in control of the programmer.
It can be tied to the system clock to produce real-time animations,
it can be slowed down or sped up,
or an entire simulation can be run at once to get simulation results quickly.

The Clock runs inside an asyncio event loop,
using the future, callback, and coroutine mechanisms familiar to asyncio users.
Gillcup uses its own :class:`~gillcup.futures.Future` objects that are tied
to a clock that handles them.
Any callbacks on a Gillcup future are handled by that future's clock;
the Gillcup time does not advance between the future's completion
and the callback execution.

A coroutine can be scheduled on a Gillcup clock using
:meth:`~gillcup.clocks.Clock.task`; see the corresponding docs for details.

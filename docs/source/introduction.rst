Introduction
============

Gillcup is a 2D animation library.

It is intended for both scripted and interactive animations:
in the former, the entire animation is known ahead of time,
and rendered as fast as possible;
the latter is gnerally tied to a system clock,
and can be influenced by user input.

The Gillcup core is only concerned with animations;
itâ€™s not tied to any particular graphics library.
